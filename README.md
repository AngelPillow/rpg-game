# rpg-game
Alpha version of a text-based rpg battle simulator , made in Python


Any feedback or recommendations are welcome. 
If this alpha version gets attention , I am going to add more features in the future , or even create something bigger and better , maybe a whole rpg game , who knows?

Thank you for reading and/or playing!

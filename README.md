# rpg-game
Alpha version of a text-based rpg battle simulator , made in Python


Any feedback or recommendations are welcome. 
If this alpha version gets attention , I am going to add more features in the future , or even create something bigger and better , a whole rpg game , not just that.

Thank you for reading!
